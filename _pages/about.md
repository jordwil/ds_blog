I'm a data scientist with a background in cell biology and genomics, and enjoy applying my background problems outside my field. When I'm not sciencing, I'm gardening, hiking, or biking. 

If you're an aspiring data scientist or analyst, please let me know in the comments if the posts are helpful and why. I'd really appreciate the feedback. 

If you're a grizzled veteran in the field and see something off or you'd approach the problem differently, I'd like to hear from you too.
